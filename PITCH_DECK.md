## 📝 Pitch Presentation Guide

### Slide 1: Title + Circular Gallery
*"Good [morning/afternoon], my name is [Your Name], and I'm here to introduce you to **Capt.today** - a platform that's transforming how we capture and preserve cultural moments using blockchain technology. These NFT cards you see spinning here represent real cultural experiences - from traditional Balinese art to ancient temples like Borobudur. Each one tells a story, and each one lives forever on the blockchain."*

### Slide 2: The Problem
*"Let me start with a problem we've all experienced. You go to an amazing cultural event - maybe a traditional festival, a museum exhibition, or a historical site. You take photos, you get a paper ticket... and then what? The ticket gets lost. The photos sit in your camera roll. There's no proof you were really there, no way to show that cultural moment mattered. And for event organizers? They have no lasting connection with attendees after the event ends."*

### Slide 3: The Solution
*"That's where Capt.today comes in. We've built an NFT-based event ticketing platform that turns attendance into collectible digital moments. Here's how it works: [point to each step] First, you discover cultural events in your area. Second, you register and receive an NFT ticket on Flow blockchain. Third, when you actually show up and check in using geo-location verification, you receive a random cultural NFT design - like opening a mystery box. Finally, you build a permanent digital collection of your cultural experiences."*

### Slide 4: Unique Value Proposition
*"Now, there are other NFT ticketing platforms out there, but here's what makes us different. First, we focus specifically on **Indonesian cultural heritage** - every NFT features authentic Batik patterns, Gamelan music, Javanese script. Second, we use a **gacha-style mechanic** - you don't choose your design, you get a random one when you check in, making it exciting and collectible. Third, **location-based verification** - we use geo-fencing to ensure you actually attended. And fourth, we're built on **Flow blockchain**, which means fast transactions, low fees, and an eco-friendly approach."*

### Slide 5: User Experience
*"For attendees, the journey is simple: discover, register, check in, and mint your NFT with an exciting reveal animation. For event organizers, it's just as easy: create your event, set your check-in radius for location verification, track real-time attendance, and engage your community with collectible rewards they'll actually want to keep."*

### Slide 6: Technology Stack
*"On the technical side, we're leveraging Flow blockchain with Cadence smart contracts - that gives us speed, security, and NFT standard compliance. Our frontend is React with TypeScript, featuring smooth animations and real-time transaction tracking. And we've built smart features like geo-fencing for check-ins, a partner system for event organizers, rarity tiers for different NFT designs, and rich cultural metadata on every token."*

### Slide 7: Market Opportunity
*"The market opportunity here is massive. We're targeting cultural events - festivals, exhibitions, heritage sites. Concerts and traditional performances. Educational institutions. And tourism - museums, cultural centers across Indonesia. Globally, the NFT market is worth over **$11 billion** in 2024, and in Indonesia specifically, we're seeing rapid digital adoption for event ticketing. We're positioned right at the intersection of these two growing markets."*

### Slide 8: Business Model
*"Our revenue model is straightforward and sustainable. Our primary revenue comes from a **5-10% platform fee** on every ticket sale. We'll offer premium features like custom cultural elements for organizers. We'll take royalties on secondary NFT marketplace trading. And we'll have subscription plans for event organizer partners. On the cost side, Flow's gas fees are minimal - most of our spend goes to development, marketing partnerships, and operations."*

### Slide 9: Traction & Roadmap
*"Where are we today? We have smart contracts deployed on Flow Testnet. Our event registration and check-in system is live. We're minting NFTs with 5 unique cultural designs. The gacha animation you'll see is production-ready. And wallet integration is complete. In the next 3 months, we're launching on Flow Mainnet, partnering with 10 cultural events in Jakarta, implementing our NFT marketplace, and expanding to 50+ design collections. In 6-12 months, we'll be in 5 major Indonesian cities, with over 1,000 events registered, 10,000 NFTs minted, and partnerships with tourism boards."*

### Slide 10: Funding Ask
*"To achieve this roadmap, we're raising a **$50K to $100K seed round** - that gives us a 6-month runway to mainnet launch. Here's how we'll use it: [point to bars] 40% goes to product development - building out the marketplace and new features. 30% to marketing and forming partnerships with event organizers. 20% to expanding our team with additional developers and business development. And 10% to operations - covering gas fees and infrastructure."*

### Slide 11: The Ask
*"So here's what we're looking for from you. Financially, we need that $50-100K in seed funding. We're looking for strategic partnerships with cultural organizations across Indonesia. We'd love network introductions within the Flow ecosystem. And marketing support to reach crypto and NFT communities. In return, you'll get equity or token allocation, early access to all platform features, a governance role in our community, and the chance to make real cultural impact while generating ROI."*

### Slide 12: Team
*"Let me introduce the team making this happen. I'm **Raihan Ardianata**, founder and blockchain lead - I came up with this idea and I'm a Flow and Cadence expert. **Adityama Fulvian** is our frontend and design lead - everything you see on screen, that's his work. **Bryan Dewa Wicaksana** handles our backend - he's an absolute expert in EVM-based chains and cross-chain architecture. And **Adzikri Fauzi Shiddiq** leads community and strategy - he's our voice to the outside world, handling BD and partnerships. We're also backed by advisors from cultural heritage organizations, the Flow blockchain community, and event industry professionals."*

### Slide 13: Vision & Thank You
*"Our vision is simple: **every cultural moment deserves to be captured forever.** From traditional festivals to modern concerts, from heritage sites to campus events - we're building the future of cultural event attendance. Blockchain-verified. Culturally rich. Forever collectible. Thank you for your time - I'd love to answer any questions, or if you're ready, click that button and explore our platform live."*
